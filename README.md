# TODO
* Improve close to goal accuracy. When particles are close to goal they miss their goal.
* Make sure particles are not spawning on a blocked grid.
* Make sure movementgrid is cleared in blocked of areas.


# Questions/Learnings
* Should all "gameobjects" derive from a gameobject class.
* Structuring code is hard.
* Try finding a book or video on game design patterns.
* Can I get particles to take a more natural path to goal. That means not moving in a less square path.
