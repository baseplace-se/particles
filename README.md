# TODO
* Improve close to goal accuracy. When particles are close to goal they miss their goal.
* Some particles passes through blocks. I think they have to much speed. Fix this. Collision detection and bounce.
* Already spawned particles get trapped in blocked off areas. Kill particles that doesnt move for a while.
* Fix the monsterous movementgrid algorithm
* Publish app on github


# Questions/Learnings
* Should all "gameobjects" derive from a gameobject class.
* Structuring code is hard.
* Try finding a book or video on game design patterns.
* Can I get particles to take a more natural path to goal. That means not moving in a less square path.
